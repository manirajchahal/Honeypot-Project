# Honeypot-Project
This project sets up an SSH honeypot using Cowrie, captures login attempts, and provides basic log analysis. The goal is to demonstrate hands-on cybersecurity skillsâ€”ranging from VM setup and network configuration to data parsing and visualization of attacker behavior.

## **Prerequisites**
-Host Machine with hypervisor such as VirtualBox or VMWare. \
-Ubuntu 22.04 to install on mentioned Virtual Machine. \
-Internet Connectivity.

## **Project Overview**
1. Set up Ubuntu on a dedicated VM to isolate the honeypot.
2. Install Cowrie.
3. Forward port 22 to Cowries default port (2222) in order to capture login attempts.
4. Capture attack logs.
5. Analyze logs with Python.
6. Visualize the data with Matplotlib.

## **Environment Setup**
1. ### Create a Ubuntu VM
     1. Download Ubuntu 22.04 ISO from [Ubuntu's](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) website.
     2. Create a new VM (ex. VirtualBox): \
        -Name: HoneypotVM \
        -Type: Linux \
        -Version: Ubuntu (64-bit) \
        -RAM: 2GB (minimum) \
        -HDD: 20GB (minimum)
   3. Attach the ISO to the VM and install Ubuntu.
   4. Choose either bridged or NAT networking type under Network. (Bridged for easier connection to other VM's and have a local IP, NAT for security).
   5. Use the following command to update your VM: \
